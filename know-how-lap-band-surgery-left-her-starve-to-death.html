<time>10 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Ivy Snitzer has recently been in a debate of speech over the internet due to her weight loss appearance. She reportedly underwent lap band surgery to solve her weight problem after she battled an eating disorder.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=#>Actress</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>comedian</a> Ivy Snitzer</strong> was the body double of <strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> in the 2001 American romantic comedy film, <i>Shallow Hal, </i>which is about a man who is hypnotized into only perceiving a person's inner beauty and falls in love with a <strong>300-pound</strong> lady. The movie was released in theatres by 20th Century Fox on November 9, 2001, and made <strong>$141 million</strong> against a <strong>$40 million</strong> budget.</p><p>Although Gwyneth Paltrow played both roles, slim and fat Rosemary, her body double Ivy Snitzer had to wear a custom-manufactured 25-pound fatsuit and prosthetic make-up for a couple of close-up shots of huge Rosemary below the neck. She later claimed that she disliked being a part of the film's production, especially having to wear the fat suit and makeup.</p><p>However, Ivy Snitzer has recently shocked the world with her lean appearance. According to the reports, she has undergone a significant weight loss journey to maintain her health as well as physique. Well, here is what we know about her transformation.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>weight loss</strong></a> stories of <strong><a href=#>Andy McConnell</a></strong>&nbsp;and <a href=#><strong>Fernando Valenzuela</strong></a>.</p><h2>Ivy Snitzer Underwent Lap Band Surgery for Her Weight Loss!</h2><p><strong>Ivy Snitzer</strong>, who played Gwyneth Paltrow's plus-size body double in Shallow Hall has <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed</a> that having weight loss surgery following the film's 2001 release left her starving to death.</p><p>She&nbsp;was a 20-year-old promising actress and comedian when she was employed as a stand-in for Hal Larson (<strong>Jack Black</strong>), a superficial man hypnotized to only sense people's inner beauty.</p><p>Meanwhile, she happily accepted the part of Paltrow's double, Rosemary, who wore a fat costume for many sequences. She thought the picture exhibited a forward-thinking stance on body ideals at the time, noticing that overweight persons frequently played unfavorable parts in films.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/08/ivy-snitzer-after-weight-loss.jpg alt="Ivy Snitzer before and after weight loss. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Ivy Snitzer before and after weight loss.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Image Source: HOUSE & WHIPS</strong></p><p>Perspectives on Shallow Hal evolved over time. Critics emphasized that the film not only made a comedy out of Rosemary's physicality but also saw it as a tragedy. Years later, Snitzer, who now owns an insurance company in Philadelphia, reflects on the film's impact on her life and self-perception.</p><p>Surprisingly, Ivy Snitzer got weight loss surgery (<strong>lap band surgery</strong>) a little more than a year after the film's debut. Later, she <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> Amelia Tait that she saw the treatment as a solution to her weight problem. The societal pressure to be thin weighed heavily on her.</p><p>She even admitted to struggling with body image, stating she loathed her body because of societal expectations. Her connection with food was difficult, with her frequently partaking in restricted diets and battling diseases she took pride in, despite the fact that they mimicked eating disorders.</p><p>However, Ivy Snitzer's journey to severe weight loss felt empowering to her since she thought she was finally taking control of a condition that everyone advised her on. She saw the huge disparity in society's treatment when she reflected on her slim days. The story serves as a reminder of the many struggles people encounter when it comes to body image and eating disorders.</p><h2>Know How Eating Disorders Affect Weight!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/08/eating-disorder.jpg alt="Eating disorders can completely change your weight and health. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Eating disorders can completely change your weight and health.<br></strong><strong>Image Source: Osmosis</strong></p><p>Surprisingly, Eating disorders are not limited to persons with smaller frames. As <a href=# rel=noopener>defined</a> by Verywell Health, Atypical anorexia nervosa refers to those who lose a lot of weight but aren't considered underweight.</p><p>Contrary to popular opinion, according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD), less than 6% of persons suffering from eating disorders are classified as underweight. ANAD further emphasizes that people with larger bodies are frequently misdiagnosed or neglected.</p><p>Similarly, <strong>Dr. Leslie A. Sim</strong> of the Mayo Clinic spoke on the difficulty doctors have in recognizing overweight individuals with eating problems because they are frequently counseled to diet. It becomes a chore that the patient believes they must complete until it spirals out of control.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGigr7FdqLuqwNmeqWavlZ60qcCMpaasq18%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fknow-how-lap-band-surgery-left-her-starve-to-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fknow-how-lap-band-surgery-left-her-starve-to-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fknow-how-lap-band-surgery-left-her-starve-to-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fknow-how-lap-band-surgery-left-her-starve-to-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fknow-how-lap-band-surgery-left-her-starve-to-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fknow-how-lap-band-surgery-left-her-starve-to-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sarunas-jackson-dating-relationship-wife-daughter-girlfriend-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sarunas-jackson-dating-relationship-wife-daughter-girlfriend-net-worth.html>Sarunas Jackson Dating, Relationship, Wife, Daughter, Girlfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hayden-panettiere-news-us-weekly.html>Hayden Panettiere News - Us Weekly</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hayden-panettiere-news-us-weekly.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
