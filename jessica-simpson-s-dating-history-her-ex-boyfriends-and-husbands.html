<time>10 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Jessica Simpson is such an “<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>open book</a>” that the pop star-turned-fashion mogul has often given fans an intimate look at many of her romantic relationships over the years. Call them <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">public affairs</a>, if you will.</p><p>From being a “newlywed” on a hit show to, more recently, spilling the juicy details of a <a href=#>secret romance with an A-lister</a>, here are the men that have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taken Simpson’s breath away</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nick Lachey</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Simpson dated Nick Lachey from 1999 to 2005. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>The first celebrity to publicly sweep Simpson off her feet was Nick Lachey, whom she met while on tour in 1999. The cute couple wed in 2002, and went on to star in their own reality show on MTV, “Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica” for three seasons.</p><p>However, the “I Wanna Love You Forever” singer and 98 Degrees band member called it quits in 2005, and their divorce was finalized in 2006. Both musicians sang about their heartbreak in their respective songs, “I Belong to Me” and “What’s Left of Me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mystery Man</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Simpson and Wahlberg both attended the 2003 MTV Movie Awards, but she claims they didn’t hook up until 2006. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Simpson revealed in 2023 that there is a mystery A-lister whom she had a flirty encounter with at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, while she was on a brief break with Lachey. The pair later shared a steamy kiss at the Beverly Hills Hotel following her split from Lachey.</p><p>While the “A Little Bit” singer never revealed his name, it is suspected<a href=#> the married movie star was Mark Wahlberg</a> since he checked off a lot of the clues she gave, including the fact he was a childhood crush of hers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Johnny Knoxville</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Simpson admitted to crushing on Johnny Knoxville in her memoir. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>Amid her marital issues with Lachey, Simpson was working on a remake of the “Dukes of Hazzard” film in 2005. Although the “Sweetest Sin” singer and her co-star Johnny Knoxville never actually dated (because they were both married at the time), Simpson wrote in her memoir, “Open Book,” that she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had an “emotional affair”</a> with the stuntman.</p><p>“I could share my deepest authentic thoughts with him, and he didn’t roll his eyes at me. He actually liked that I was smart and embraced my vulnerabilities,” the “Where You Are” singer wrote in her book. “He believed in me and made me feel I could do anything.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Adam Levine</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Simpson was rumored to have dated Levine in 2004 and then again in 2006. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Some reports claim Simpson cheated on Lachey with Levine in 2004, but those claims have never been confirmed.</p><p>However, there appears to be proof that the “With You” singer and Maroon 5 frontman did hook up at one point. In January 2006, a post-divorce Simpson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was seen leaving</a> the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles after reportedly spending the night Levine’s house.</p><p>Then <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tabloid reports </a>from March 2006 claimed the “She Will Be Loved” singer dumped the “These Boots Are Made for Walking” singer via text message.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Mayer</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Simpson dated John Mayer off and on throughout 2006. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Simpson was swooned by sultry crooner John Mayer and dated the “Your Body Is a Wonderland” singer in 2006. The pair appear to have had a very passionate relationship and Mayer once <a href=#>called Simpson “sexual napalm”</a> in a now-infamous Playboy interview.</p><p>However, the “Irresistible” songstress and “Gravity” singer also seemed to have somewhat of a toxic romance. Simpson revealed in her memoir that she and Mayer were always on again, off again, and <a href=#>broke up around nine times </a>during their short-lived relationship.</p><p>“We were great at intimacy,” the “Open Book” author shared in 2020. “We were great at loving each other. That was easy, but the relationship was very complex.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tony Romo</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Simpson dated Tony Romo for about a year and a half. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Simpson took a break from dating musicians to link up with NFL pro Tony Romo in November 2007. However, at the time, the MTV darling <a href=#>got a lot of heat </a>for her then-boyfriend’s poor game plays.</p><p>Romo then reportedly <a href=#>dumped Simpson </a>the day before her 29th birthday in 2009. The “Fashion Star” judge later revealed <a href=#>Mayer caused her split</a> with the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback because she would still communicate with her ex, whom she said still had a “hold” over her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Billy Corgan</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Simpson and Billy Corgan never confirmed their rumored romance. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Simpson met Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan when he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote the song for her new show</a> at the time, “The Price of Beauty,” in 2010. The duo appeared to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">share a mutual admiration</a> for each other, which sparked dating rumors.</p><p>They never confirmed the romance — despite sources saying otherwise — and when asked about it, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Corgan played coy</a>, saying, “The stuff that I’ve seen doesn’t have any bearing to the reality that I’m in. It’s like being in a cartoon. It has nothing to do with what’s really going on or how I feel.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eric Johnson</h2><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>3</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p class="ad__label ad__label--top">Advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/NYPICHPDPICT000006092750.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/NYPICHPDPICT000006092753.jpg><p><span class=screen-reader-text>Advertisement</span></p><p>Simpson started dating former NFL athlete Eric Johnson in May 2010, while he was still married to his then-wife, Keri D’Angelo.</p><p>There are conflicting reports about whether the ex-tight end and teacher were actually separated when he met the pop star, but <a href=#>their divorce was finalized</a> by October 2010.</p><p>Simpson and Johnson then <a href=#>went on to get married</a> in July 2014, and have been together ever since. They share three kids: Maxwell, Ace, and Birdie Mae.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKKVqMCqr8BmqqKloKi8r7%2BMnZitoZ6ceqm10q2mq7FdnbKzecSxZJunqZu%2FqrHNnapmmZ6ZeqnB0puYp5yjZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjessica-simpson-s-dating-history-her-ex-boyfriends-and-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjessica-simpson-s-dating-history-her-ex-boyfriends-and-husbands.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjessica-simpson-s-dating-history-her-ex-boyfriends-and-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjessica-simpson-s-dating-history-her-ex-boyfriends-and-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjessica-simpson-s-dating-history-her-ex-boyfriends-and-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjessica-simpson-s-dating-history-her-ex-boyfriends-and-husbands.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sos-to-bad-by-aerosmith-lyrics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sos-to-bad-by-aerosmith-lyrics.html>Sos to bad by aerosmith lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./i-m-too-1-hit-for-right-said-fred.html>I'm Too ___ (#1 hit for Right Said Fred)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./i-m-too-1-hit-for-right-said-fred.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
