<time>19 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Kevin Costner, a celebrated actor, producer, and director, has made a significant mark in the world of entertainment.</p><p>With a career spanning several decades, he’s garnered numerous awards and accolades for his outstanding performances.&nbsp;However, recent developments have left fans wondering about his future in the hit series “Yellowstone.”&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s look into the reality of Kevin Costner’s departure from the show and also explore his personal life, including the recent news about his marriage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Kevin Costner?</strong></h2><p>The American actor, producer, and director of motion pictures is Kevin Michael Costner. His birthday is January 18, 1955.&nbsp;</p><p>A Primetime Emmy, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and more honors have been bestowed upon him.</p><p>He rose to prominence by starring in leading roles in a string of critically acclaimed films such as The Untouchables (1987), Bull Durham (1988), Field of Dreams (1989), and JFK (1991).</p><p>In the 2012 miniseries Hatfields & McCoys, on television, Costner played Devil Anse Hatfield, for which he received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.&nbsp;</p><p>He has been starring in the Paramount Network original drama series Yellowstone since 2018, for which he was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award and won a Golden Globe.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Did Kevin Costner quit Yellowstone?</strong></h2><p>Yes, Kevin Costner quit Yellowstone. Due to scheduling conflicts with his new film series, Horizon: An American Saga, which he is both directing and starring in, <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=492>Kevin Costner</a> is leaving Yellowstone.&nbsp;</p><p>Season 5 of Yellowstone was broken up into two parts, but before filming for the second part began, Costner expressed that he wanted to film for fewer days than what he was originally scheduled for.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kevin-Costner-1024x576.jpg><p>At the time, Deadline reported that Costner wanted to film for 50 days instead of 65 for Part 1, and for Part 2, he only wanted to film for a week, which Yellowstone executives felt was too short.</p><p>Negotiations between the two sides went back and forth before coming to an abrupt end.</p><p>Then, it was revealed that Yellowstone’s fifth season, part two, would be its final one and that a brand-new show starring Matthew McConaughey would ostensibly replace it.</p><p>When he broke his silence on his departure, Costner stated that he had wanted to make things work and that he had already changed his schedule to film Part 1, and scripts for Part 2 weren’t finished.&nbsp;</p><p>I couldn’t help them anymore. We tried to negotiate, and they offered me less money than in previous seasons.</p><p>There were issues with the creative. We came up with a number, and Yellowstone walked away.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel="noopener nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Kevin Costner & Modern West (@kevincostnermodernwest)</a></p><p>In addition, Costner has hinted that he might file a lawsuit to receive his full payment for Season 5, so it seems like things could get heated once more.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Costner is leaving the program, this does not imply that he will not return to the show in the future.</p><p>It is said that discussions are still ongoing about Costner making a few cameos to finish off his character’s arc before he is written off.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Taylor Sheridan, the showrunner, hinted to The Hollywood Reporter that John Dutton would never make it to the very end of the series and that his preferred conclusion remains unaltered even in light of Costner’s departure.</p><p>In any case, it might be some time before we find out what transpires with Yellowstone and Costner.</p><p>The SAG-AFTRA strike is still going strong, so it is possible that we will not see the final Yellowstone episodes until 2024.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Kevin Costner married?</strong></h2><p>The 18-year union between Christine Baumgartner and Kevin Costner has ended. On May 1, 2023, she filed for divorce from the Yellowstone Star, claiming that they had irreconcilable differences.&nbsp;</p><p>September saw the end of their acrimonious court battle and their divorce settlement. Regarding his life with Baumgartner and their kids, Costner has mostly kept it quiet over the years.</p><p>2020 saw Costner say, I am so grateful for Christine as a partner. Our home is similar to a river; all you have to do is go with the flow.</p><p>Boutiques sell handbags designed by Baumgartner under the Cat Bag Couture brand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kwbd7w6KbZqOVq7avecKoqq2mlad6ssHIrWSynZyhvLi%2F06ilnmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-kevin-costner-quit-yellowstone-a-look-into-the-reality.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-kevin-costner-quit-yellowstone-a-look-into-the-reality.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-kevin-costner-quit-yellowstone-a-look-into-the-reality.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-kevin-costner-quit-yellowstone-a-look-into-the-reality.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-kevin-costner-quit-yellowstone-a-look-into-the-reality.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-kevin-costner-quit-yellowstone-a-look-into-the-reality.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jerry-falwell-jr-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jerry-falwell-jr-net-worth.html>Jerry Falwell Jr. Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./christopher-young-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Christopher Young Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./christopher-young-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
