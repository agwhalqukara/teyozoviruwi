However, he and his wife Jessica avoid partnering up in the kitchen as it can lead to some disagreements.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/828e2a0f3086-gino-wife-jessica-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e31hAqmZGwNph data-wc=9><strong>The couple have been together for nearly three decades</strong></p><p id=ehqRpfWQulkvK data-wc=58>"Me and my children cook together but it doesn't happen often because you can imagine our life is so hectic," he divulged.

There is always someone in the kitchen with me but not my wife though. Not my wife because we argue in the kitchen. She says that she knows best but I say that I know best. So it's always one or the other."</p><p id=e5ASjyDpTP2Sw data-wc=52>Although the couple are very passionate about their cuisine, Gino was full of praise for his wife. <strong>"She's a great cook," he added. "I would say 80 per cent&nbsp;of the time it's done by her and 20 per cent&nbsp;of the time it's done by me because I come home late."</strong></p><p id=e77QwGq9KZWT1><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/73b589fcd8f8-inside-luciano-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=es1Do3ozVI0d9 data-wc=6><strong>Inside Luciano at ME Hotel London</strong></p><p id=enjV1bv-GdT9V data-wc=41>Meanwhile, over the past few weeks, proud dad Gino has been helping his eldest son Luciano make his name in the world of cuisine.
