Fortunately for us, the folks over at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Animated TV</a> have the answer.

A futuristic take on the basic concept of other notable animated cartoon “The Flintstones”, George Jetson and his family became an instant favorite among viewers and reruns continue to this day.</p><h2 id=19-betty-boop class=joli-heading>19. Betty Boop</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-2.jpg></p><p>Everyone can recognize number 19 on our list of animated characters: the one and only Betty Boop. Originally a black and white cartoon created in the 1930’s by animator Max Fleischer, Betty Boop is essentially a caricature of a 1920’s flapper. As one of the first talking cartoon characters ever, Betty Boop became an instant classic.</p><h2 id=18-fat-albert class=joli-heading>18. Fat Albert</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-3.jpg></p><p>Famous for the catch phrase “Hey, Hey, Hey!” Fat Albert comes in as the 18th most popular animated character of all time.

This in itself has endeared Mr. Magoo to generations, thus winning the character a well-deserved spot on our list.</p><h2 id=15-scooby-doo-and-shaggy class=joli-heading>15. Scooby Doo and Shaggy</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-6.jpg></p><p>First appearing in “Scooby Doo, Where Are You?” in 1969, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy come in at number 15 on our list.

The characters have been popular ever since, so much so that they starred in several live action movies in the 2000’s. Mix in the original show’s theme song and you’ve got the makings of some of the most popular animated characters of all time.</p><h2 id=14-porky-pig class=joli-heading>14. Porky Pig</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-7.jpg></p><p>One of the most recognizable Warner Brothers animated characters, as well as all time, Porky Pig comes in at number 14 on our list.

Daffy Duck</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-8.jpg></p><p>Yet another Warner Brothers Animation character to grace our list, the number 13 most popular animated character of all time is Daffy Duck.

Eric Cartman</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-9.jpg></p><p>Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone unleashed something truly unique when they created Eric Cartman way back in 1997.

Spongebob Squarepants</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-10.jpg></p><p>He lives in a pineapple under the sea, he’s Sponge Bob Square Pants coming in at number 11 on our list. While one of the more modern characters to grace our list, having been created in 1999, SpongeBob Squarepants is no less important. Now known the world over thanks to his still running television show on cable network Nickleodeon, this well-meaning but simple minded sponge resides in the town of Bikini Bottom and always seems to find himself on wacky adventures. Spongebob Squarepants is so popular that Nickelodeon even went so far as to release a movie featuring the character in 2015.</p><h2 id=10-rocky-and-bullwinkle class=joli-heading>10.

One of the many timeless characters created by children’s author Dr. Seuss, The Grinch comes in at number 7 on our list of most popular animated characters of all time. Not only is his theme song catchy, The Grinch finds himself onto our list because no holiday season would be complete without watching him scheme to steal Christmas in the animated classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas.</p><h2 id=6-fred-flintstone class=joli-heading>6. Fred Flintstone</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-15.jpg></p><p>In what could be considered the precursor to Homer Simpson, Fred Flintstone plays the patriarch of the prehistoric Flintstone family.

One of the most popular of which is Bart Simpson, son of main characters Homer and Marge Simpson. Unlike his sister Lisa, Bart is a tried and true trouble maker, the antics of which are the focus of many an episode. Ask any random stranger on the street who Bart Simpson is and they with almost certainly know exactly who you’re talking about.</p><h2 id=3-mickey-mouse class=joli-heading>3.
